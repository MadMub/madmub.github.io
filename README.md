My personal static website, given the limited abilities of gh-pages, think of the root folder (this one) as normal projects /dist folder, where the build process dumps the final index.html. As a result, _workspace is the (you guessed it) workspace. This presents a bit of an anti-pattern in that "compiled" code is version controlled, to mitigate some of that pain, _workspace is located on the dev branch, and master represents by latest stable build which I have checked out/cherry picked from dev.
